## 🌐 About The Project

This is my personal portfolio website, designed to showcase my journey as an **AI Engineer** and **Full Stack Developer**. 

It is built with a **"Neural" design philosophy**—clean, futuristic, and responsive. The site features advanced scroll animations, glassmorphism UI elements, and a fully functional contact system without a backend server.

### ✨ Key Features
* **Futuristic UI:** "Glass Control Panel" aesthetic with Dark Navy & Neon accents.
* **Smooth Animations:** Integrated `AOS` (Animate On Scroll) for premium reveal effects.
* **Interactive Elements:**
    * Liquid "Chat" Button.
    * Holographic AI Core Animation.
    * Auto-filling Skill Progress Bars.
    * Floating 3D Timeline Icons.
* **Responsive Design:** Fully optimized for Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop (Bootstrap 5).
* **Functional Contact Form:** powered by Formspree (AJAX integrated).
